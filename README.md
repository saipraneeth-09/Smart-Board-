# Smart-Board-
his project implements a virtual drawing board using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and NumPy, allowing users to draw on a digital canvas using hand gestures. The system detects hand landmarks and enables color selection, drawing, and erasing functionalities using fingertip tracking.

 Hand Gesture-Based Drawing – Draw using your index finger like a virtual pen.

✅ Color Selection – Choose from predefined colors (Red, Blue, Yellow, Green).

✅ Eraser Mode – Clear the canvas using a hand gesture.

✅ Real-Time Hand Tracking – Uses MediaPipe Hands for accurate finger detection.

✅ Smooth Drawing – Draws lines dynamically as the user moves their hand.

Hand Detection: Uses MediaPipe Hands to track finger movements.

Gesture Control: The index finger acts as a pen, and color selection is done by touching virtual buttons.

Drawing Mechanism: The script draws on a blank canvas that overlays the webcam feed.

Eraser Mode: Can be activated to clear the canvas.
